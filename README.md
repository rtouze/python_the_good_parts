This is a presentation I made at work about Python and its coolest parts in my
humble opinion.  


It has the form of a [Jupyter][jup] notebook, which is directly interpreted by
Github.  

If you want to generate the slides, just ask Jupyter to convert it:

    jupyter nbconvert --to=slides --post=server python_the_good_parts.ipynb
